# Whack-a-Mole
This is a rather simple game made with p5.js. <br>
Your goal is to try to "click" the mole that randomly appears in holes.<br>

# How do I run the game?
You can clone and run, or play the online version here: http://laphatize.me/Whack-A-Mole/index.html <br>

# Difficulty
I probably should add a option to adjust the difficulty, if you edit the last line of code  called `sleep(1000)`, adjust the time to the desired time. Note it is by miliseconds, so a second is a 1000 milliseconds.
